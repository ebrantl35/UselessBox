# Useless Box

## Description

This project was to create a box which turns itself off. It did this by using a servo arm which was activated by the same switch that it turns off. I made a rectangular box with a top that was cut in half. The attached half had the switch mounted on it and the servo, and the hinged side was able to be pushed up by the arm to allow for opening and closing.

## Reflection

This project was a lot of fun! It was the first truly unguided project that I had the opportunity to do, and it was so gratifying to push through roadblocks and solve problems on my own. I started out a bit nervous, as it had been a while since I had done any serious CAD work, but once I got the hang of things again, I became much more confident and started to move through tasks much more quickly. This project really helped me gain a better understanding of the edit in context tool, which I had to use a lot. I was unable to complete the project because I was working on the Servo Project with Zac every Monday, so i couldn't devote any in-the-lab time to 3D printing the parts of my box and assembling it.
